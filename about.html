          The act of consuming chocolate is often associated with pleasure and
          indulgence. Our brains form positive emotional associations with
          certain foods, and chocolate is no exception. The anticipation, taste,
          and texture of chocolate can trigger feelings of enjoyment and
          happiness, leading to an overall positive mood.

          chocolate has the ability to boost our levels of serotonin and
          endorphins, which promote feelings of happiness and pleasure in the
          brain. So, when we're feeling down or stressed, reaching for a square
          of dark chocolate could be considered a form of self-care.
